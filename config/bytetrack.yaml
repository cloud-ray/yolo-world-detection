# Confidence threshold for strong track associations (Default: 0.5)
# Detections with confidence above this threshold will be considered strong matches for existing tracks

# Confidence threshold for weak track associations (Default: 0.1)
# Detections with confidence above this threshold but below track_high_thresh will be considered weak matches for existing tracks

# Confidence threshold for initiating new tracks (Default: 0.6)
# Detections with confidence above this threshold and not matching any existing tracks will initiate a new track

# Buffer size to calculate the time when to remove tracks (Default: 30)
# Tracks that have not been updated for this many frames will be removed

# Similarity threshold for matching tracks (Default: 0.8)
# Tracks with similarity above this threshold will be considered a match
